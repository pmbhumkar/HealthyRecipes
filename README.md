Get recipes according to main ingredient

Enter the main ingredient like spinach, chicken etc and the web page will show all the dishes that contains the main ingredient. And If clicked on the dish name then you will get full desciption that includes cuisine type, ingredients required along with measurements for the dish, cooking instructions and youtube video.

I developed this by using two API's that provides recipes and their details. I used Javascript to query API's and show the results in HTML.
